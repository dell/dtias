## Why

Ansible is one of those things that often becomes very messy. The reason we strictly enforce coding standards from the outset is twofold:

1. To make sure the project is extensible over time
2. To ensure that people other than the original author can maintain, update, or extend the codebase

## Style

See [Coding Style Good Practices for Ansible](https://github.com/grantcurell/automation-good-practices/blob/main/coding_style/README.adoc)

For writing Python modules:

See [PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)

## Coding Structure

See [Good Practices for Ansible](https://github.com/grantcurell/automation-good-practices/tree/main)

## Helpful Tools

For Ansible, use [Ansible Lint](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/lint/)

There is an [Ansible linter extension for vscode](https://developers.redhat.com/learning/learn:ansible:get-started-ansible-visual-studio-code-extension/resource/resources:ansible-lint-integration-ansible-vs-code-extension)

For Python, use [Python Linter](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting)
